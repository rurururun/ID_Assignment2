            <h1>Snake & Hunter</h1>
            <p>
                Snake & Hunter is a spin off from the original snake game. In this game, players must avoid the hunter, and avoid crashing into your own body or else it's game over. <br/><br/>
                The hunter moves along the pathway indicated with gray color. Apples will spawn at random places on the map, eating an apple earns you 1 point. <br/><br/>
                There are power ups in this game, banana (Increases snake movement speed by 50%), orange (Decreases hunter movement speed by 50%). <br/><br/>
                Players are able to go through the border of the map to come out on the other side of the map. <br/><br/>
                After game is over, leftover power ups are converted into points with each power up scoring 10 points, the final scores will be tabulated and be assessed in the leaderboard section. Every 10 apples ate, the hunter's movement speed and the conversion rate of the power ups will increase by 10%. Through this game, players will be able to learn about spatial awareness and plan their moves ahead of time. Players will also be able to increase their reaction speed as the game gets faster as it progresses. Will you have what it takes to get the top rank on the leaderboard?

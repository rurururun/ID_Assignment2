# Project Name: Snake & Hunter
This project is a redone snake game made from html css and js. In the game, you will be able to control your snake on a 20x20 board with the goal of gaining the most points which will be featured on the leaderboard. There will be various fruits that have different capabilities to consume with the snake, each affecting the game uniquely. There will also be a hunter present on the board that will kill your snake upon contact that moves in a straight line on the black line visible on the board. When the game ends, your score will be tabulated based on the number of fruits you have consumed. Will you have what it takes to get the top rank on the leaderboard?

# Design Process
This game was designed aiming to be an interesting spin off of the typical snake game where there are now various fruits that give special powers for a set amount of time. It can be used by people who want more variety from the original snake game made in 1976 which is 47 years ago.
